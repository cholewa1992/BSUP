\section*{Target project.}
Our target project is the project performed by ourselves for the ITU course 
Second Year Project: Software Development in Large Teams with International Collaboration.
In this project we are to collaborate with a team of students from Singapore University
developing a computer system for uploading and downloading resources. The system will have two
individual frontends with a shared backend. In addition we are required to document the design
of the system as well as our collaboration with the singaporian students.

\section*{Problem statement}
In this project we aim to clarify the following questions in regards to the target project.	
\textbf{How can you plan, execute and evaluate the target project?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item	How can you estimate the time required for each of the subtasks of the target project?
	\item 	How can you balance estimated time with available time to reach a satisfying product by the set deadline?
	\item 	How can you choose a fitting process model for the target project?
	\item 	How can you manage resources and keep the target project on track?
	\item 	Which parts of the target project could have been done differently for a better result?
\end{itemize}
